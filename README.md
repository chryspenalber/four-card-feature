## Overview

This project is a **Product Preview Card Component** that displays four features (Supervisor, Team Builder, Karma, and Calculator) with icons and descriptions. It was built with a clean and modern aesthetic, ensuring responsiveness on various screen sizes. The component is styled using **CSS Grid** and **Flexbox** to create a flexible layout.

## My Process

The development process followed a structured approach:

1. **HTML Structure:** Defined the layout with semantic HTML tags for better accessibility and SEO.
2. **CSS Layout:** Implemented CSS Grid and Flexbox for layout and alignment.
3. **Styling:** Used CSS custom properties (variables) for colors and typography to keep the design consistent.
4. **Responsiveness:** Designed the component to be mobile-first and responsive, using media queries to adjust the layout on smaller screens.

### Built With

- **HTML5** (Semantic elements)
- **CSS3** (Custom properties, Grid, Flexbox, Media queries)
- **Google Fonts** (Poppins)


**CSS Features:**

- **CSS Variables:** Used for color management.
- **CSS Grid:** For responsive layout with the use of grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows.
- **Flexbox Layout:** To align the content within each feature container.
- **Typography:** Poppins font family for a clean and modern look.
- **Hover Effects:** Added hover states for interactive links in the footer.

### What I Learned

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with:

- **CSS Grid** for organizing elements into a structured and responsive layout.
- The use of **CSS Variables** to maintain consistent color schemes.
- **Flexbox** for aligning and spacing content inside grid items.
- Enhancing **mobile-first design** by adjusting layouts and elements for smaller screen sizes.

### Continued Development

Future improvements could include:

- Implementing **JavaScript** for added interactivity, such as dynamic content loading.
- Improving **accessibility** by adding ARIA attributes and labels.
- Exploring **CSS Grid** further for more complex layouts.
